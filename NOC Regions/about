This CSV file contains data on the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and their respective regions or countries. 
It includes a three-letter NOC code, the name of the country or region, and any additional notes where relevant. 
For example, some countries like Curacao (AHO) and Bohemia (BOH) have historical or alternative references, and other regions such as Antigua and Barbuda (ANT) 
or Australasia (ANZ) are noted with their specific participation. This data can be useful for analyzing Olympic participation and tracking which regions 
or countries have competed over time.
